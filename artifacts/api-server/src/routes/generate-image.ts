/**
 * Converts one recommendation's structured styling data into an edit
 * instruction. The image model only ever visualizes a styling decision made
 * by the recommendation engine (see routes/recommendations.ts) — it never
 * invents its own outfit, colour, or styling strategy.
 *
 * Identity preservation is a real, documented weak point of image editing:
 * the further the requested composition is from the input photo (e.g. a
 * tight face-crop selfie -> a full-length editorial shot), the more room
 * the model has to "reinterpret" the face rather than preserve it. Two
 * prompt-level things mitigate this regardless of which API path is used
 * (see the route handler below for the API-level mitigation):
 * (1) very explicit, repeated identity instructions up front and again at
 * the end (models weight both ends of a prompt more heavily), and
 * (2) requesting waist-up/portrait framing instead of full-length, which is
 * a much smaller transformation from a typical selfie and empirically
 * preserves the face far better.
 *
 * Pose and head angle are re-composed regardless of the input photo's
 * angle: many real uploads are casual low-angle selfies (phone held below
 * eye level, chin tucked, eyes cast down/sideways), and preserving that
 * literal head angle would carry the "bad selfie" framing into a supposedly
 * polished result. The instructions below explicitly ask for eye-level
 * camera and a confident straight-on gaze regardless of how the input
 * photo was angled — only the FACE is preserved, not the camera angle or
 * head tilt it happened to be photographed at.
 *
 * Fit/drape is called out explicitly too: "preserve their build" alone
 * only prevents the model from altering body shape — it says nothing about
 * whether the generated garments actually fit that build correctly. The
 * dedicated fit instruction below asks for the outfit to look tailored to
 * this specific person's proportions (shoulder line, sleeve/hem length,
 * fabric fall), not merely worn.

 * Bare-minimum, last-resort line used ONLY when writeStylingAddendum()
 * (below) — the actual decision-maker — could not run or returned nothing
 * at all (e.g. no photo provided, or every vision-agent call attempt

 * the prompt isn't left with a hole, not as a real styling decision. Every
 * real decision (pose, expression, hairstyle rendering, body language,

/**
 * Prompt-writing agent — the PRIMARY decision-maker for this look's pose,

 * vision call that actually looks at the user's real photo (their real face
 * shape, features, apparent build, framing) plus the look's styling data,
 * and decides what pose, expression, and hairstyle rendering would
 * genuinely look natural and flattering ON THIS SPECIFIC FACE for this
 * specific look — not a lookup from a fixed set of mood keywords.
 *
 * History of this function (do not regress to earlier approaches — both
 * were tried and failed in production):
 * 1. A keyword-matched template picking a pose "family" from the look's
 *    title/category text — too generic, expressions barely changed.
 * 2. This function as free-form prose (3-5 sentences) — an improvement,
 *    but real production batches still came back with near-identical
 *    expressions/poses across all 5 looks AND near-identical, barely-changed
 *    hairstyles across different users entirely. Two causes: (a) the 5
 *    parallel per-look calls have no visibility into each other, so they
 *    independently converge on the same "safe" photographer-cliché answer
 *    regardless of vibe; (b) free prose gives the model room to write
 *    something plausible-sounding without committing to a genuinely
 *    different value, and hairstyle specifically kept losing to the
 *    identity-preservation instructions in the final edit prompt.
 * 3. Current fix (this version): structured JSON output with discrete
 *    required fields (forces commitment to specific values instead of
 *    vague prose), explicit sibling-look vibe awareness (told what the
 *    OTHER looks in this batch already used, and instructed to actively
 *    avoid repeating them), and an explicit, forceful hairstyle-rendering
 *    field paired with a matching forceful instruction in
 *    buildLookEditPrompt() that clarifies changing hairstyle does NOT
 *    violate identity preservation.
 * 4. Further fix: removed the last hardcoded pieces from generate-image.ts —
 *    a fixed pose/environment template string and 3 fixed gender-branched
 *    "flattering" paragraphs that used to sit in buildLookEditPrompt()
 *    regardless of what this agent decided. Now environment/setting and
 *    "what will genuinely look best on this person" are additional
 *    required fields on THIS agent's own output (environmentAndSetting,
 *    flatteringDirection) — reasoned fresh per request from the actual
 *    photo, look, and occasion, with pronouns passed only as context for
 *    tone, never branched into a fixed template. Nothing about pose,
 *    expression, hairstyle, environment, or "what looks good on this
 *    person" should ever be decided by a fixed string in this file again —
 *    if a future change needs a new dimension of styling decision, add a
 *    field to StylingAddendum and this prompt, not a new template function.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT get to decide identity POLICY — the one mandatory,
 * non-negotiable rule (keep the same face/identity, seamlessly blended, not
 * pasted-looking) is always injected by buildLookEditPrompt() regardless of
 * what this agent returns, so a malformed or oddly-worded agent response
 * can only add nuance, never weaken or drop that one constraint. If this
 * call fails for any reason, the caller falls back to
 * buildMinimalPoseFallback() — a single neutral line, not a styling
 * decision — rather than failing the whole request.
