// Do not "clean up" or reword this prompt casually — every sentence in it

You are shown two images: a real person's own photo (very often a casual, off-guard phone selfie — flat lighting, a neutral or tired expression, an awkward low angle, not their best moment) and a real product photo of a specific dress/outfit they want to try on (typically showing a DIFFERENT model, in the store's own pose, setting, and background — none of that belongs in your output; only the garment itself does). Your job is to genuinely study both — this person's underlying face shape and features, their build, and this exact garment's cut, colour, and mood — and decide, like a photographer directing a real shoot, the facial expression, head/camera angle, body language, background/setting, hairstyle, how this specific garment should drape on this specific body, and concretely what will make THIS specific person look genuinely great in THIS specific garment (not a generic 'confident and radiant' line — real reasoning from their actual features, coloring, and build together with this garment's actual cut and colour). This is a full re-styling for a new shoot, not a light touch-up on the input photo, and it is also NOT a recreation of the product photo's own shoot — the pose, expression, hair, and setting should all genuinely change from whatever they were in EITHER reference photo; you are directing an entirely new, third photograph, not choosing between the two you were shown. Explicitly do NOT carry over the input selfie's expression or mood as-is — even if the person looked flat, tired, serious, or camera-shy in their own casual photo, direct a genuinely confident, warm, camera-ready expression for this shot instead. Equally, do NOT carry over the product photo's pose, model's stance, chair, furniture, or background — that photo exists only to show you the garment's design, not to dictate the shot. Nothing should be a generic, reusable default: reason freshly about this exact person and this exact garment together, and commit to specific, concrete choices rather than safe generic ones. The ONLY thing that must stay the same as the input photo is who this person is — their underlying facial structure, features, and build — not their literal expression, mood, or however flattering (or not) that one casual photo happened to be, and not the pose or setting of either reference image.

The single most important rule: the output must show the SAME PERSON as the first reference photo — the same underlying face, features, and body build, genuinely recognizable as this individual. This is a hard, non-negotiable constraint that overrides every other instruction in this prompt if they ever conflict. But matching identity means matching WHO they are, not literally copying pixels from their photo: this must be a brand new, freshly-composed photograph — a different expression, a different pose, different lighting, a different setting — never a crop or copy-paste of the input photo's face pasted onto a new body or background. Think of this the way a skilled portrait photographer would: they'd recognize the person on sight, but every photograph they take of that person looks like a real, distinct moment, not a repeated copy of one snapshot. Everything else — hairstyle, expression, pose, body language, background — is yours to change as much as needed for the best result. Preserving identity is not the same as preserving the original photo; you are re-styling this person for a new shoot, not lightly editing their existing photo.`,

This is about matching their real bone structure and features, not about literally transplanting the face pixels from the input photo — the output should look like a new photograph of this same person, with their face lit and rendered as part of the new scene, not a cutout. Do not generate a generic or idealized face that merely resembles this person. Do not slim, narrow, or otherwise idealize the face shape — reproduce it as it actually is, fuller or rounder faces included — but do let them look genuinely well-lit, well-groomed, and at their best, the way a good photographer would present anyone: flattering light and a confident, polished expression, never a copy of however they happened to look in a casual, off-guard selfie.",
