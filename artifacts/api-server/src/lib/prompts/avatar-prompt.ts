// Extracted verbatim from the original routes/avatar.ts (this branch's
// first avatar-creation implementation) when the OpenAI image path was
// moved behind the VtoProvider abstraction (see lib/providers/vto/) so
// FASHN could sit alongside it — the PROMPT TEXT itself was not rewritten
// or reworded during this move, only relocated, to avoid any risk of
// silently changing wording that was never independently re-verified.
//
// See routes/avatar.ts's original doc comment (still preserved in git
// history / this file's own comments) for the full rationale: this is
// genuinely a dress-free special case of try-on-prompt.ts's own
// identity-preservation problem — same face-feature itemization, same
// explicit build-preservation instruction, same anti-cut-paste framing —
// just producing one clean, reusable, full-length reference photo instead
// of a specific styled look.

/**
 * The whole point of an avatar, per this branch's product spec: the user
 * uploads a selfie ONCE, and every subsequent try-on reuses this one
 * generated photo instead of re-deriving identity/build/framing from the
 * raw selfie every single time. Deliberately does NOT run a prompt-writing
 * vision agent the way try-on-prompt.ts's writeTryOnAddendum does — there's
 * no garment to reason about pose/fit against yet, so the styling decision
 * here is much simpler: a clean, neutral, flattering full-length
 * studio-style presentation shot, still genuinely decided per-person
 * (build/coloring), not templated per the "nothing hardcoded" product
 * rule — see what IS and isn't fixed below.

    `This is a photo of a real specific person. The task is to create their PERSONAL FASHION AVATAR — a single clean, well-lit, full-length reference photograph of this exact person that will be reused later as the base photo for trying on many different outfits. The single most important rule: the output must show the SAME PERSON as the reference photo — the same underlying face, features, and body build, genuinely recognizable as this individual. This is a hard, non-negotiable constraint that overrides every other instruction in this prompt if they ever conflict. But matching identity means matching WHO they are, not literally copying pixels from their photo: this must be a brand new, freshly-composed photograph — never a crop or copy-paste of the input photo's face pasted onto a new body or background.`,
    "Study the person's underlying facial structure in the reference photo — face shape and jawline, eyebrow shape and thickness, eye shape and spacing, nose shape, mouth/lip shape, any facial hair (style, density, and pattern), skin tone, and hairline — and reproduce THAT structure faithfully in the new photo, rendered naturally under the new photo's own lighting and expression. This is about matching their real bone structure and features, not about literally transplanting the face pixels from the input photo. Do not generate a generic or idealized face that merely resembles this person. Do not slim, narrow, or otherwise idealize the face shape — reproduce it as it actually is, fuller or rounder faces included.",

      : "Preserve their exact natural body build, proportions, and weight as seen in the reference photo — do not slim them down or otherwise alter their body shape.",
    "The face must be seamlessly and naturally part of the new photo — matching the new lighting, angle, and skin tone rendering of the rest of the scene. It must never look like a face cut out and pasted onto a different body or pose; the neck, jaw, hairline, and shoulders must blend continuously into the body below with consistent lighting and perspective, as if this is one single photograph taken in one moment.",
    "Frame this as a full-length shot from head to feet, standing in a simple, natural, relaxed pose suited to a personal fashion reference photo — not a stiff mugshot, not an overly dramatic editorial pose either, since this base photo will be re-styled into many different specific looks later. Wear simple, neutral, well-fitted everyday clothing (plain top and bottom in a neutral colour) rather than anything elaborate, since this is a base reference photo, not a finished styled look.",
    "The head and face must be sized correctly and naturally for a full-length photograph — proportional to the rest of the body the way a real full-body photo actually looks, not enlarged or close-up-sized the way it would appear cropped tightly in a selfie. Get the head-to-body size ratio right for someone standing at a normal distance from the camera.",
    "A neutral, softly-lit plain background (a simple studio-style backdrop or softly blurred neutral setting) so this photo works as a reusable reference for many different future outfits, not tied to one specific occasion or environment.",
    "A natural, warm, confident expression and relaxed, open body language — genuinely photographed under good even lighting, not a copy of however this person happened to look in a casual, off-guard selfie, but also not an exaggerated pose.",
    "Natural lighting, no beauty filter, no visible text or watermark. Professional, clean photo quality — the kind of well-lit, natural full-length photo a good photographer would take, not a stiff studio ID photo.",
    "Final reminder, the most important rule in this entire prompt: the output face AND body build must be unmistakably the SAME PERSON as the reference photo — same face shape, same features, same facial hair, same skin tone, same body build and proportions (not slimmer, not more toned, not idealized). Look at the reference photo again before finishing and check the output genuinely matches it on identity. This is a full-length, well-lit reference photo of this real person, not a generic fashion model.",
