// Image Generation Service
// -------------------------
// Architecture:
//
//   Recommendation Engine  →  5 LookRecommendation objects  →  Image Generation Service  →  5 images
//
// This module is the ONLY place in the frontend that talks about images. It
// sends each LookRecommendation's structured styling data — plus the user's
// own uploaded photo — to the backend (/api/generate-image, which calls
// OpenAI's gpt-image-2 images.edit endpoint), and returns each look with a
// real imageUrl showing THE SAME PERSON re-dressed in that look, not a
// generated stranger. It never decides the styling strategy itself — that's
// the recommendation engine's job (see services/recommendation-engine.ts).
// UI components must not import a provider SDK directly; they call
// generateLookImages() and stay unaware of how images are produced.
//
// The actual provider call (and the OpenAI API key) lives server-side in
// artifacts/api-server/src/routes/generate-image.ts — never in this file —
// so the key is never exposed to the browser.
//
// One request per look, not one batch request for all 5: a single generated
// image (even compressed) can run into a few MB, so bundling 5 into one
// JSON response risks tripping body-size limits somewhere in the deployment
// chain (this was a real production bug — see CLAUDE.md). Per-look requests
// keep each request/response small and let the UI show each image as soon
// as it's ready instead of waiting on the slowest of five.

 *
 * profile.photoUrl IS sent here (unlike recommendation-engine.ts, which
 * strips it) — the backend edits that photo so each look shows the same
 * person, not a generated stranger. If the user skipped the photo step,
 * the backend falls back to text-to-image generation.
