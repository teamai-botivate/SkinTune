// Shopping Session / Search Memory Service (real-dress-avatar-intelligent-tryon branch)
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Tracks the "search memory" this branch's product spec calls for (sections
// 21-27): which dresses have been shown, which the user marked Interested/
// Not Interested (with an optional reason), so "Research Again" and "Refine
// Search" can steer away from repeats without the caller needing to
// reconstruct that history by hand each time.
//
// Lives entirely in memory + is exposed as a plain object rather than a
// class specifically so App.tsx's existing useState-based state management
// (no external state library in this codebase) can hold and update it the
// same way it holds every other piece of screen state — see App.tsx's
// `sessionMemory` state and its handlers for Interested/Not Interested.
// Deliberately NOT persisted to localStorage: a shopping session is
// explicitly temporary/per-visit (this branch's "TEMPORARY SESSION VS
// PERMANENT PROFILE" rule, section 12) — losing it on a hard refresh is the
// correct behavior, not a bug to fix later.
